## I am using { Personal } Jekyll Theme

{ Personal } is a free responsive Jekyll theme, about you :wink:

Personal Website | Portfolio | Personal Brand | Resume | CV | Blog 

Ajulu's Personal Website Jekyll Theme is a free responsive Jekyll theme, forked from personal-jekyll-theme. I added my personal info, contact form, analytics, and removed one or two things here and there.

Soon to add a work/portfoilo and education section.

I'll soon upload a more professional readme and change my domain name to something more professional: stephenajulu.com
