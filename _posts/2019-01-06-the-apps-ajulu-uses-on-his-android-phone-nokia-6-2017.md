<p><br><br>Hey guys, how are you doing? It's Ajulu's Thoughts back again with another post: The Apps Ajulu Uses On His Android Phone(Nokia 6 2017)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br><br>Now a brief intro to who Ajulu is and his device specs. Ajulu is the founder, author and editor in chief of Ajulu's Thoughts. A tech blog that has been steadily growing. Last year Ajulu's Thoughts reached 100 views, this year we have been slowly rising to 200 views(might not sound as an accomplishment but to us it is) we went from 1 writer: Ajulu and now we have 3 writers. The reason you haven't seen them around is because they are researching on their upcoming posts.</p>

<p><br><br>Now to Ajulu's device, i(Ajulu) have a Nokia 6 Ta-1000, 2017 version running Android 7.1.1. Screen estate is 5.5 inches with HD. I also have 4gb Ram and 64gb Internal. It's running an octa core processor: Qualcomm MSM8937 Snapdragon 430(a slightly old processor but nevertheless efficient). For more specs please do refer to my other post: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/nokia-6-the-durability-phone-come-back/">Nokia 6: The Durability Phone Comeback</a></p>

<p><br><br>Now sometime back i mentioned how smartphone manufacturers are trying to make desktops and laptops obsolete. I have heard of a phone with 32gb Ram, 320gb internal memory and an incredible 16 core processor: this is insane! Anyway back to the topic, this is my only phone, i use it to do a lot of things, i run it in desktop mode using Sentio Desktop(a launcher with desktop mode) and Scrcpy(ADB Mirror Screen for those who have a laptop or desktop with ADB configured), i run linux on it(Using UserLAnd and Termux), i hack with it(Termux with Kali NetHunter and UserLAnd with Kali Linux Rootfs in it), i check my files from USB drives and external hard drives using USB OTG(on the go), i blog with it(WordPress app), i take professional photos with it(it has 16 mega pixel back with a pro mode camera app and i use Snapseed &amp; Photoshop Express to edit them) and many other apps i use.</p>

Some of the beats it generates positively affect and increase intelligence, knowledge absorption, sleep. What are binaural beats:The word binaural means ‚Äúhaving or relating to two ears‚Äù. This represents&nbsp;the process, which works by simultaneously sending a marginally&nbsp;different sound frequency to each ear through headphones. <span class="s1">Brainwave entrainment happens inside the brain, and is caused by a physiological response. Upon hearing two tones of different frequencies ‚Äì sent simultaneously to the left and right ears ‚Äì the brain perceives&nbsp;a third tone based on the mathematical difference between the two frequencies.The brain then follows along at the new frequency and produces brainwaves at the same rate of Hertz (Hz). </span>To know more about Binaural Beats, refer here: <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320019.php">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320019.php</a><br><strong>Bitwarden</strong> - This is my password manager of choice.
