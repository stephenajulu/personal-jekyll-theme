<p class="has-drop-cap">Bob Collymore has announced he will be staying on as CEO of Safaricom  for one more year (12-15 months) as his contract has been extended.  This is part compensation for the 9 month period of time he was out on  medical leave. So he will remain the CEO up to 2020.</p>

<p>A successor is yet to be picked and there’s been growing conversation
 over who will be able to take over from Bob as he was expected to leave
 in August. There’s been rumors that the government of Kenya wants to 
have a Kenyan as the company’s CEO, but such conversation is yet to take
 shape.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://tech-ish.com/2019/05/03/safaricom-full-year-2019-results/">Safaricom Full Year Results</a>
 announcements, the Board Chair made a fun statement saying Safaricom 
already has a Kenyan CEO pointing to Bob Collymore being Kenyan already.</p>

<p>Collymore who is of Guyanese descent, has been CEO of Safaricom since
 they year 2010 and has overseen the company’s growth to becoming one of
 the biggest, and most profitable companies in East and Central Africa. 
In his tenure, M-Pesa has grown to become the world’s largest mobile 
money solution, and going by stats from their results last year, there’s
 still so much more for M-Pesa.</p>
