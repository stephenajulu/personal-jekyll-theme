Hi Guys , Recently as i browsed the web, to be specific Youtube i encountered quite an interesting video that talked about how any non touch screen device can support touch. I was quite thrilled to see how it worked, in just in a minute i will review it.

The AirBar works by bouncing infrared light off your fingers, interpolating where your fingers touch the surface of the screen. Make no mistake: A genuine touchscreen is more precise and offers more flexibility in terms of multitouch capabilities. But for those who want an inexpensive-but-serviceable alternative, the AirBar does the job.

The device is one must have device if you enjoy a touch screen but have none. It is a plug and play device meaning everyone can install , operate and use it, it has magnets that easily attaches/sticks at the base of your computer screen. The genius company that created it is non other than Neonode, a Swedish Company.

<strong>How Does It Work?</strong>
<div>AirBar is a small plug-and-touch bar that attaches magnetically to the bottom of your machine’s display.</div>

<div>When connected to your laptop via an available USB port, AirBar starts emitting a beam of invisible light across your screen that is used to track touchscreen movements and gestures.</div>
<div>The movements and gestures are then translated into corresponding inputs, making you able to use all the gestures including poking, pinching, swiping, zooming and scrolling around with your hand, in the same way, like on a touchscreen PC.</div>
<div>It works even if you have worn gloves, and with any other object e.g paintbrushes, sticks and etc.</div>

<div>
<div>AirBar works well with any device running Windows 8 or Windows 10 or even with a Chromebook, <del>but it still needs to have proper OS X support. </del></div>
<div>Currently supports OS X.</div>

<div>It currently retails at $79 Internationally and Ksh.15,050 Kenya</div>
