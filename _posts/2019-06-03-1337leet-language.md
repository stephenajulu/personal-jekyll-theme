<p class="has-drop-cap">With the latest hack that affected most government websites. Hackers love attention, so the particular member of Kurd Electronic Team left his signature on the websites. Many are left wondering what exactly does the perpetrator's name mean. Well today i would like to introduce you to the 1337 aka leet language. A language that gain popularity in the late 1900's and early 2000's. And seems to be gaining traction again. It seems to be mostly used by hackers, security conscious users, gamers, I.T pros and just general computer/net users.</p>

<p><strong>History:</strong>  Hacker "Sp33k" for leet, or elite. Originating from 31337 "eleet", the UDP port used by Dead Cow Cult, a hacker group, to access Windows 95 using Back Orifice, a notorious hacking program. <br>Leet originated within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin board systems</a> (BBS) in the 1980s,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#cite_note-mitchell-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#cite_note-bbc-2">[2]</a></sup> where having "elite" status on a BBS allowed a user access to file folders, games, and special chat rooms.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow">Cult of the Dead Cow</a> hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>  One theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_operators">system operators</a> for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_cracking">cracking</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)">hacking</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#cite_note-mitchell-1">[1]</a></sup>  Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to  attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer  users.  <br>Once the reserve of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)">hackers</a>, crackers, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">script kiddies</a>, leet has since entered the mainstream.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#cite_note-mitchell-1">[1]</a></sup> It is now also used to mock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newbie">newbies</a>, also known colloquially as noobs, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#cite_note-rome-4">[4]</a></sup> Some consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon">emoticons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a>,  like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists  of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving  the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers,  continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication.  It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have  been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance "@$$"  (ass) and "$#!+" (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear  censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with  leet. <br>Leet symbols, especially the number 1337, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme">Internet memes</a>  that have spilled over into popular culture. Signs that show the  numbers "1337" are popular motifs for pictures and shared widely across  the Internet. </p>

<p><strong>What exactly is leet language? Well I'll borrow the definition from </strong><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com"><strong>Urban Dictionary</strong></a><strong> :</strong>  A language in which numbers and symbols are put together to look like letters. Some people create their own 1337 letters and it makes them look more 1337 by fellow 1337-speakers.  </p>
