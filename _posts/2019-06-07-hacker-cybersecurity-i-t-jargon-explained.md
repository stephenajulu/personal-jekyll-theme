<p class="has-drop-cap">Have you ever installed an antivirus tool on your computer? Read a story about WikiLeaks or the Arab Spring? Opened a bank account? Then hacking is important to you, even if  remains largely in the background of your life. It makes sense to get  informed about it. Unfortunately, it is a very technical subject, with a  great deal of specialized vocabulary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve put together a glossary of what I believe to be the most important and current hacking, cybersecurity and information technology terms you should know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Adware: </strong>Adware can mean the software that 
automatically generates advertisements in a program that is otherwise 
free, such as an online video game. But in this context it more commonly
 means a kind of spyware that tracks your browsing habits covertly to 
generate those ads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anonymous: </strong>A non-hierarchical hacktivist collective, Anonymous  uses hacking (and arguably cracking) techniques to register political  protest in campaigns known as “#ops.” Best known for their distributed  denial of services (DDoS) attacks, past activities have included attacks  against the Church of Scientology; Visa, Paypal, and others who withdrew their services from WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange  after that group began releasing war documents; #OpTunisia and others  purporting to support the Arab Spring; and a campaign that brought down  the website of the Westboro Baptist Church. #Ops are usually marked with the release of a video of a reader in a Guy Fawkes mask using a computer generated voice. Offshoot groups include AntiSec and LulzSec.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>AntiSec: </strong>An Anonymous splinter group, AntiSec  was best known for the hack of security firm Stratfor, publishing  credit card numbers and email addresses taken from the company’s site. Jeremy Hammond was arrested for alleged Anti-Sec activities under the alias sup_g.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Back door: </strong>A back door, or trap door, is a hidden 
entry to a computing device or software that bypasses security measures,
 such as logins and password protections. Some have alleged that 
manufacturers have worked with government intelligence to build 
backdoors into their products. Malware is often designed to exploit back
 doors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Black hat: </strong>Black
 hat hackers are those who engage in hacking for illegal purposes, often
 for financial gain, though also for notoriety. Their hacks (and cracks)
 result in inconvenience and loss for both the owners of the system they
 hack and the users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bot: </strong>A program that automates a usually simple 
action so that it can be done repeatedly at a much higher rate for a 
more sustained period than a human operator could do it. Like most 
things in the world of hacking, bots are, in themselves, benign and used
 for a host of legitimate purposes, like online content delivery. 
However, they are often used in conjunction with cracking, and that’s 
where its public notoriety comes from. Bots can be used, for instance, 
to make the content calls that make up denial of service attacks. Bot is
 also a term used to refer to the individual hijacked computers that 
make up a botnet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Botnet: </strong>A botnet is a group of computers controlled 
without their owners’ knowledge and used to send spam or make denial of 
service attacks. Malware is used to hijack the individual computers, 
also known as “zombies,” and send directions through them. They are best
 known in terms of large spam networks, frequently based in the former 
Soviet Union.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Brute force attack: </strong>Also known as an exhaustive key 
search, a brute force attack is an automated search for every possible 
password to a system. It is an inefficient method of hacking compared to
 others like phishing. It’s used usually when there is no alternative. 
The process can be made shorter by focusing the attack on password 
elements likely to be used by a specific system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Clone phishing: </strong>Clone phishing is the modification 
of an existing, legitimate email with a false link to trick the 
recipient into providing personal information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Code</strong>: Code is the machine-readable, usually 
text-based instructions that govern a device or program. Changing the 
code can change the behavior of the device or program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Compiler: </strong>A compiler is a program that translates 
high-level language (source code in a programming language) into 
executable machine language. Compilers are sometimes rewritten to create
 a back door without changing a program’s source code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cookie: </strong>Cookies are text files sent from your Web browser to a server, usually to customize information from a website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cracking: </strong>To break into a secure computer system, frequently to do damage or gain financially, though sometimes in political protest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Denial of service attack (DoS): </strong>DoS is used against a
 website or computer network to make it temporarily unresponsive. This 
is often achieved by sending so many content requests to the site that 
the server overloads. Content requests are the instructions sent, for 
instance, from your browser to a website that enables you to see the 
website in question. Some have described such attacks as the Internet 
equivalent of street protests and some groups, such as Anonymous 
frequently use it as a protest tool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Distributed denial of service attack (DDoS): </strong>A DoS 
using a number of separate machines. This can be accomplished by seeding
 machines with a Trojan and creating a botnet or, as is the case with a 
number of Anonymous attacks, by using the machines of volunteers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Doxing: </strong>Discovering
 and publishing the identity of an otherwise anonymous Internet user by 
tracing their online publically available accounts, metadata, and 
documents like email accounts, as well as by hacking, stalking, and 
harassing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Firewall: </strong>A system using hardware, software, or both to prevent unauthorized access to a system or machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gray hat: </strong>Just like the rest of life, hacking is 
often less black or white than it is gray. The term gray hat hacker 
reflects that reality. A gray hat hacker will break the law in the 
pursuit of a hack, but does not do so maliciously or for personal gain. 
Many would argue Anonymous are gray hats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hacking: </strong>Hacking is the creative manipulation of 
code, distinguished, albeit amorphously, from programming by focusing on
 the manipulation of already written code in the devices or software for
 which that code was already written. Metaphorically it extends to 
social engineering in its manipulation of social code to effect change. 
Many prefer to use the term cracking to describe hacking into a machine 
or program without permission. Hackers are sometimes divided into white 
hat, black hat, and gray hat hackers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hacktivist:</strong> A hacker whose goals are social or  political. Examples range from reporting online anonymously from a  country that attacks free speech to launching a DDoS campaign against a  company whose CEO has issued objectionable statements. Not to be  confused with slacktivism, which refers to push-button activism in which  a supporter of a social or political campaign’s goals does nothing but  register their support online, for instance by “liking” a Facebook page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hash: </strong>A hash is a number generated by an algorithm 
from a string of characters in a message or other string. In a 
communications system using hashes, the sender of a message or file can 
generate a hash, encrypt the hash, and send it with the message. On 
decryption, the recipient generates another hash. If the included and 
the generated hash are the same, the message or file has almost 
certainly not been tampered with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IP: </strong>Internet protocol address. It’s the distinctive 
numeral fingerprint that each device carries that’s connected to a 
network using Internet Protocol. If you have a device’s IP you can often
 identify the person using it, track its activity, and discover its 
location. These addresses are apportioned by the regional Internet 
registries of the IANA (the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). 
Crackers can use knowledge of your IP address to your computer via one 
of its ports, the points that regulate information traffic flow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IRC: </strong>Internet relay chat is a protocol used by both 
groups and for one-on-one conversations. Often utilized by hackers to 
communicate or share files. Because they are usually unencrypted, 
hackers sometimes use packet sniffers to steal personal information from
 them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Keystroke logging: </strong>Keystroke logging is the tracking
 of which keys are pressed on a computer (and which touchscreen points 
are used). It is, simply, the map of a computer/human interface. It is 
used by gray and black hat hackers to record login IDs and passwords. 
Keyloggers are usually secreted onto a device using a Trojan delivered 
by a phishing email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Logic bomb: </strong>A virus secreted into a system that 
triggers a malicious action when certain conditions are met. The most 
common version is the time bomb.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>LulzSec: </strong>LulzSec
 is an Anonymous offshoot. It’s best-known actions were hacking user 
information from the website of Sony Pictures and for allegedly shutting
 down the CIA website with a DDoS attack. LulzSec’s best known, however,
 for Hector Xavier Monsegur, a.k.a. “Sabu,” a hacker turned FBI 
informant, whose intel led to the arrest of four other LulzSec members. 
He faces the possibility of a long prison term despite his cooperation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Malware: </strong>A software program designed to hijack, 
damage, or steal information from a device or system. Examples include 
spyware, adware, rootkits, viruses, keyloggers, and many more. The 
software can be delivered in a number of ways, from decoy websites and 
spam to USB drives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Master: </strong>The computer in a botnet that controls, but 
is not controlled by, all the other devices in the network. It’s also 
the computer to which all other devices report, sending information, 
such as credit card numbers, to be processed. Control by the master of 
the bots is usually via IRC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>NSA: </strong>The National Security Agency  is the U.S. intelligence group dedicated to intercepting and analyzing  data, specifically electronic data. Although not the only intelligence  organization in the U.S., much less the world, to engage in suspect  surveillance, thanks to former NSA contract analyst Edward Snowden’s  leak of the agency’s classified documents, it has become the most  celebrated and reviled one. You can find a complete guide to the NSA and  its many programs here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Payload: </strong>The cargo of a data transmission is called 
the payload. In black hat hacking, it refers to the part of the virus 
that accomplishes the action, such as destroying data, harvesting 
information, or hijacking the computer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Packet sniffer: </strong>Sniffers are programs designed to 
detect and capture certain types of data. Packet sniffers are designed 
to detect packets traveling online. Packets are packages of information 
traveling on the Internet that contain the destination address in 
addition to content. Packet can be used to capture login information and
 passwords for a device or computer network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Phishing: </strong>Tricking someone into giving you their 
personal information, including login information and passwords, credit 
card numbers, and so on by imitating legitimate companies, 
organizations, or people online. Phishing’s often done via fake emails 
or links to fraudulent websites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Remote access: </strong>Remote
 control is the process of getting a target computer to recognize your 
keystrokes as its own, like changing a TV with a remote control. Gaining
 remote access allows you to run the target machine completely by using 
your own, allowing for the transfer of files between the target and the 
host.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Rootkit: </strong>A rootkit is a set of software programs 
used to gain administrator-level access to a system and set up malware, 
while simultaneously camouflaging the takeover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Script kiddie: </strong>A pejorative term for a would-be 
cracker without technical skills. Script kiddies use prefab cracking 
tools to attack systems and deface them, often in an attempt to score 
points with their peers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social engineering: </strong>A custodian is to a janitor as a
 social engineer is to a con man. Social engineering is conning people 
into giving you confidential information, such as passwords to their 
accounts. Given the difficulty of breaking, 128-bit encryption with 
brute force, for example, social engineering is an integral element of 
cracking. Examples include phishing and spear-phishing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Spam: </strong>Unwanted and unsolicited email and other 
electronic messages that attempt to convince the receiver to either 
purchase a product or service, or use that prospect to defraud the 
recipient. The largest and most profitable spamming organizations often 
use botnets to increase the amount of spam they send (and therefore the 
amount of money they make).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Spear-phishing: </strong>A more focused type of phishing, 
targeting a smaller group of targets, from a department within a company
 or organization down to an individual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Spoofing: </strong>Email spoofing is altering the header of 
an email so that it appears to come from elsewhere. A black hat hacker, 
for instance, might alter his email header so it appears to come from 
your bank. IP spoofing is the computer version, in which a packet is 
sent to a computer with the IP altered to imitate a trusted host in the 
hope that the packet will be accepted and allow the sender access to the
 target machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Spyware: </strong>Spyware is a type of malware that is 
programmed to hide on a target computer or server and send back 
information to the master server, including login and password 
information, bank account information, and credit card numbers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Syrian Electronic Army: </strong>The SEA is a pro-government hacking group, best known for defacing high-profile publications like the <em>New York Times</em>  and National Public Radio (and the Daily Dot). Recently, Vice and Krebs  on Security have doxed several alleged members of the group. Some have  accused them of being less hackers than script kiddies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Time bomb: </strong>A virus whose payload is deployed at or after a certain time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Trojan horse: </strong>A Trojan is a type of malware that 
masquerades as a desirable piece of software. Under this camouflage,&nbsp;it 
delivers its payload and usually installs a back door in the infected 
machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Virus: </strong>Self-replicating malware that injects copies 
of itself in the infected machine. A virus can destroy a hard drive, 
steal information, log keystrokes, and many other malicious activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vulnerability: </strong>A weak spot hackers can exploit to gain access to a machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Whaling: </strong>Spear-phishing
 that targets the upper management of for-profit companies, presumably 
in the hope that their higher net worth will result in either more 
profit, if the cracker is after financial gain, or that their higher 
profile will ensure the gray hat hacker more exposure for his or her 
cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>White hat: </strong>An ethical hacker who uses his skills in 
the service of social good. The term may also be applied to a hacker who
 helps a company or organization, or users in general, by exposing 
vulnerabilities before black hat hackers do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Worm: </strong>Self-replicating,
 standalone malware. As a standalone it does not report back to a 
master, and unlike a virus it does not need to attach itself to an 
existing program. It often does no more than damage or ruin the 
computers it is transmitted to. &nbsp;But it’s sometimes equipped with a 
payload, usually one that installs back doors on infected machine to 
make a botnet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Zero day exploit: </strong>A zero day attack is a previously 
unknown vulnerability in a system. A zero day attack is the first such 
use of the exploit by a cracker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
