<p class="has-drop-cap">The
 PCI Special Interest Group has announced the next version of the 
popular I/O interface for connecting peripherals to computers. The 
latest version almost doubles on the speeds provided by PCIe 4.0.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190529005766/en/PCI-SIG%C2%AE-Achieves-32GTs-New-PCI-Express%C2%AE-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a blog post</a>,
 PCIe 5.0 can deliver a raw data rate of around 32GT/s (gigatransfers 
per second). This translates to roughly 128GB/s transfer speeds over 
16-lane (x16) configuration. In comparison, PCIe 4.0 over x16 provides a
 total of 16T/s or 64GB/s.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So,
 for PCIe 5.0, the transfer speed is 64 GB/s for each input and output 
operations. For your reference, it delivers 4GB/s in each direction over
 a single lane (x1) configuration.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, PCIe 5.0 adds 
support for a new CEM connector designed for add-in cards and also 
provides backward compatibility to all PCIe 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, and 1.0 
versions. It also improves on the mechanical performance and the signal 
integrity of the connectors.</p>

<p>The development of the new version 
took less than two years since PCIe 4.0 was officially announced back in
 2017. The group’s Chairman AI Yanes has called it a “<em>major achievement”</em> and said that such technologies are required for new data-intensive applications that require high performance.</p>

<p>As
 you might know, PCI Express is a common interface used to plug in stuff
 like hard drives, graphics cards, and Wi-Fi cards. However, it’s 
another thing that the older version PCIe 4.0 is itself a rare 
occurrence on most of our laptops and desktops.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, it remains to be seen how the PCI Special Interest Group plans to improve the adoption of the new version.</p>
