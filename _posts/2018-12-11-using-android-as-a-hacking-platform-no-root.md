<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey guys, How are you doing? Today i would like to touch on a topic for white hats, green hats and penetration testing/ethical hacking enthusiasts out there. Hacking and Pentesting using your smartphone.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now before we start I'd like to point out a few things:- First many fail to see the potential of their smartphones, a smartphone is basically a very portable computer more portable than a laptop. In recent times some smartphones have become powerful enough to completely destroy the need of a full sized computer or a laptop. Such as Samsung Galaxy S7, S8 and many others. The smartphone i currently have(Nokia 6 2017 Matte Black version) has Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 Octacore clocked at 1.40 GHz with a Random Access Memory(RAM) of 4GB. Now from these specs, you can see they rival an ordinary Laptop. Even surpassing many with 2GB RAM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Second thing is Android is Linux(Built on Linux), therefore is capable of handling some Linux commands through the help of Busybox (I'll talk on this in another post). Not forgetting all Operating Systems capable of performing attacks are based on Linux e.g. Kali Linux, Parrot OS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now with these things in mind. We can now proceed to our agenda. The first step to being able to pentest is to check which android version, you are running. This is essential because one of the apps needed is limited to Android 5.0.0 and above(Termux)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>NOTE: Please know all written here is for educational purposes! I will not be held responsible for any damage done to you or any network or device.&nbsp; Leave it to the professionals, white hats and true ETHICAL hacking enthusiasts! Do not do any kind of hacking/pentesting to anyone's network or computer, unless given written permission to do so unless the network belongs to you. To be on a safer ground use softwares like Vmware Workstation/Player and Virtual Box to virtualize android, windows and other operating system. Then use that to practice. I will post links for the softwares.</strong></p>

<ol><li> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux"><strong>Termux</strong></a> - Now this is a very important app, it is a terminal emulator i found in my pursuit to master Linux commands through guide apps on the Playstore. It captivated me, now i use it almost everyday. This is not like the other terminal apps, it is a terminal emulator for Android. It's key difference from other terminal emulators is, it has it's own package repository with huge set of various utilities. Terminal emulator is a program that provides a text-based interface to the shell. It has Linux packages in it, therefore supporting<em><strong> apt</strong></em>. Termux is an <strong>Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app</strong> that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically     - additional packages are available using the APT package manager. I'll explain and talk about this in another post. You can install Metasploit-Framework, THC Hydra, Nmap, Radare2, Bettercap, Kali Nethunter(Chroot) among others which i will talk about in another post. Aside from this you can SSH into servers, compile python, perl, go, clang, php and other programing languages and even run them. You can use it as a text editor and learn Linux on the go. Note: You can download it from Google Playstore but its add-ons are priced, for free download them from<strong> </strong><a href="https://search.f-droid.org/?q=termux&amp;lang=en"><strong>https://search.f-droid.org/?q=termux&amp;lang=en.</strong></a> Though you will need to download the stores app. When download choose one store as they are signed differently, choose either Playstore or Fdroid.&nbsp; For more information about it visit their wiki page here: <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page"><strong>https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page</strong></a><strong> </strong>or their main site<strong>:</strong><a href="https://termux.com/"><strong> https://termux.com/</strong></a> for more info you can visit this XDA forum: <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/termux-the-ultimate-linux-terminal-emulator-for-android-xda-spotlight/"><strong>https://www.xda-developers.com/termux-the-ultimate-linux-terminal-emulator-for-android-xda-spotlight/</strong></a><br></li><li> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard"><strong>Hacker's Keyboard</strong></a> -&nbsp; This keyboard has separate number keys, punctuation in the usual places, and arrow keys.

LOIC can help users with testing server data flow by emulating controlled traffic flow. Since LOIC supports all three socket protocols (UDP, TCP, and HTTP), LOIC could thus be used with any type of server. It is basically a DOS tool. It does this by flooding a network or website with packets and traffic until the receiver denies incoming packets/traffic.<br><strong>Features:<br><em>+ Full control over traffic flow<br>+ Send data packet to any IP address<br>+ Various methods to send data packets (HTTP, UDP, or TCP)<br>+ Retrieve IP address from any real web-address <br>+ Send data packets to any port<br>+ Fast and efficient compared to other leading apps</em></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitramite.cryptography">Cryptography</a></strong> - This allows anyone with zero skills to encrypt, decrypt text, files,images and also learn about cryptography.

Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis. Android 4.0 and lower, you can download older versions from <strong><a href="https://guardianproject.info/releases/">guardianproject.info/releases/</a></strong> or through the FDroid.org open app store at <strong><a href="https://f-droid.org">Fdroid</a></strong>. The last release with KitKat and older support is: <strong><a href="https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-v14.1.4-UpToKitKat-nonPIE.apk">Orbit v14.1.4.</a></strong> Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. As the New York Times writes, “when a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it’s from.” Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award.<br>Accept no substitute: Orbot is the safest way to use the Internet on Android. Period. Orbot bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait. Any installed app can use Tor through Orbot's built-in VPN. Tor can help you confidentially research a competitor, get around someone blocking your favorite site, or circumvent a firewall to watch sports at work. Now for enhanced security and use download either <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox"><strong>Orfox</strong></a><strong> </strong> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser_alpha"><strong>Tor Browser(Alpha Stage)</strong></a><strong> </strong>from the Playstore.

Our mission is to make advanced online privacy and security available to everyone. Install this VPN app now for free and use it to keep your IP address private, protect your Internet connection on public Wi-Fi, and access geo-restricted content. They never log user activity or share user data with third parties. Even if authorities request information on users’ online activity, they don't provide because they don't have it. It uses ciphers with Perfect Forward Secrecy, meaning your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted later, even if an encryption key gets compromised in the future. Unlike other VPN services, with ProtonVPN there’s no free plan trial period, and you can browse as much as you want. ProtonVPN is the ONLY free VPN that has no privacy-invading ads, no malware, no bandwidth limits, and does not secretly sell user data. Their free service is supported by paid plans, where users get more privacy features and access to faster, exclusive servers.</li><li> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=berserker.android.apps.sshdroid"><strong>SSHDroid</strong></a> - is a SSH server implementation for Android.<br>This application will let you connect to your device from a PC and execute commands (like "terminal" and "adb shell") or edit files (through SFTP, WinSCP, Cyberduck, etc...)
