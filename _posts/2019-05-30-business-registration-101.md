<p>Effective January 1, 2005, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) took 
over stamp duty collection from the Ministry of Lands and Housing. As an
 administrative requirement, the KRA now requires the personal 
identification numbers (PINs) of all parties on whose behalf 
duty-stamped documents are submitted. Documents must be first assessed 
by the Stamp Duty Office before payment can be processed by the 
KRA-designated banks. The process has lengthened initially to about 2 
weeks because the Stamp Duty Office waited to receive confirmation of 
bank payment after clearance of funds. However, the time has reduced in 
2008 as a result of better communication between the Ministry of Lands 
and housing and Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to 5-10 days. Bank 
handling charges of KES 100 for each transaction are also due.</p>

permits required for a distributor of goods or provider of services to 
carry on its business activities. Applicants having obtained a business 
permit to operate from one local authority will not be required to 
obtain another business permit in another local authority. In addition, 
business permit applicants will have an opportunity to elect whether to 
apply for a 1- or 2-year permit. The 2006 law also eliminated the

but participation is mandatory. The employer pays a standard 
contribution of about 1% of salary, subject to a maximum of KES 400 per 
month. Half the contribution is deductible from the employee’s salary.

Insurance Fund (NHIF), which must be deducted by the employer from the 
employees’ salary. The maximum contribution is KES 320 per month. The 
contributions are used to offset the costs of medical treatment, but 
they only cover a fraction of actual costs. Hence, most companies 
provide employees with medical insurance.</p>

<h2>How to Register a&nbsp;Business in Kenya – registering a sole 
proprietorship in kenya and&nbsp;how to register a partnership business in 
kenya</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The procedure to register a sole proprietorship / partnership in 
Kenya is pretty easy and should not cost more than Kshs 900/-. Here is 
what you need to do:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Pick out a business name that you wish to register</strong>.
 Write a simple letter addressed to the “Registrar General”. This letter
 need only ask the registrar to confirm if your chosen business name is 
available for registration.</li><li><strong>Make your way over to Sheria House</strong>, and to the Registrar of Companies within the Sheria House compound.</li><li><strong>Go over to counter No 1 and hand in your letter(s</strong>). You will need to pay <strong>Kshs 100</strong>
 for every name that you wish to register. This is what is called 
“business name search”. The process takes three days to a week, max 
(usually). You will receive a blue receipt.</li><li><strong>Three days after handing in your letter</strong>, go back to
 Sheria House and show the attendant your receipt. If your chosen name 
is available for registration, you will receive a letter from the 
registrar of companies that, basically, tells you your name search was 
successful. You will also receive a form, <strong>Form BN/2</strong>.</li><li><strong>What you need to do is fill out Form BN/2 as completely as possible</strong>.
 If you are registering a sole proprietorship, the part where it says 
“Particulars of proprietor or partners” will bear only one name, 
otherwise you can put in up to 20 partners (for a partnership).</li><li><strong>Go back to Sheria House and hand in your completed Form BN/2</strong>. You will need to pay <strong>Kshs 800/-</strong>.
 After a week or so, you will have to go back to Sheria House to collect
 your business registration certificate. Congratulations, you shall then
 have registered a new business.</li></ol>

<h3>Business&nbsp;Registration in Kenya – About Partnership</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process of registering a sole-proprietorship and partnership is the same at Sheria house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because of the unique nature of partnerships (the fact that 
one partner’s actions can make other partners equally liable) it is 
recommended that one also registers a partnership deed that clearly 
defines rights, duties and obligations of all partners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A partnership deed once drawn up is supposed to be registered as a public document at the Ministry of Lands.</p>
