<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Hi guys, how are y'all doing? Today we will talk about privacy, anonymity and security. As i mentioned in the previous post <a rel="noopener" href="https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2018/08/24/the-key-to-uncrackable-passwords-the-best-password-guide/" target="_blank">The Password Guide.</a> Edward Snowden the guy who aired out the dirty laundry of several large corporations, who are reading, seeing and hearing every piece of data in the world. And i know what you are thinking! What do i have to hide? They can keep on seeing them? but this is a naive way of thinking. They are using highly advance programs to hear every call you make, every text you send and social media. Therefore i must warn you, this will be a very long post as i will go in depth. Now before we start let me disarm those who say they have nothing to hide with a quote from Mr. Edward Snowden: <span><b>"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say,"</b></span></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {"id":1099} --><figure class="wp-block-image"><img class="wp-image-1099" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/cuanBn.jpg" alt="" /> <figcaption>Source: Mic/AP </figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Now as a start, you should know there are governments alright with this Global Mass Surveillance, in fact they signed it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:quote --><blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The UKUSA Agreement is an agreement between the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to cooperatively collect, analyze, and share intelligence.

There are security settings one can change, though some could possibly make it a little less useful. And there are also apps that could completely replace Google services, even some better than Google's. You could use Google and these side by side, then decide(<i>of which i highly discourage this due to Google tracking you all over the internet</i>) One thing you should know Google is a monopoly. It has the greatest video streaming service in existence:- YouTube of course, now this is the only thing that cant be replaced as all others such as Vimeo are abit low on content and have some strict rules(<i>as i have heard from friends who have used it, not my words</i>) There are other services(<i>few</i>) that cant be replaced, i will not even bother mentioning their replacements because that's just a waste of time. Hopefully soon they will rise and be capable of defeating google. Another point is, i wont explain Google services unless necessary, i wll just mention the replacements and their pros. So without hesitation:-</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --><h4><i>G-MAIL VS PROTONMAIL E-MAIL OR TUTANOTA EMAIL OR DISROOT OR MAILFENCE:</i></h4><!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Now for Email you could use Protonmail, its the best, has a free and paid version.
