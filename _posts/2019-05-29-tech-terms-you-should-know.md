<p>68. <strong>NFC (Near Field Communication)</strong><br>NFC is technology that lets mobile devices communicate using radio  waves when theyâre very close to each other (about four inches or less)  and is used for services like sharing files, pairing accessories, or  wireless payments. Companies can use NFC to make products interactive  with consumersâ mobile devices, such as including NFC-enabled tags on  products that allow users to register products, get discounts, or place  new orders with their mobile device.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>69. <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong><br>Responsive web design is the practice of designing websites so that  they adapt gracefully to different-sized devices like phones, tablets,  wearable devices, etc. If youâre able to visit a website on your phone  and it looks just as proportional and seamless as it does on your  computer, itâs an example of responsive web design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>70. <strong>SDK (Software Development Kit)</strong><br>SDK is a set of tools for creating specific types of software.
