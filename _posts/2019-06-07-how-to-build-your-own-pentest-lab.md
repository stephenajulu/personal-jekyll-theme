<p class="has-drop-cap">If you’re interested in a career in penetration testing then testing 
your skills is a must. Having your own home penetration test lab is a 
great way to test new pentesting skills and penetration testing 
software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Practicing is always the best way to improve your skills, however, 
the problem with hacking is that any real-world practicing on live 
systems could land you in legal trouble that will damage your future 
cybersecurity career more than lacking a few skill points here and 
there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The solutions to this problem is a home penetration testing lab. In  this article, I’ll tell you how to build your own lab so you can  improve your hacking and penetration testing skills. There are several  different options to having your own pentest lab, they all have their  pros and cons so we’ll explore some options below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>SOLUTION 1: EXPENSIVE AND NOT ADVISED FOR BEGINNERS: CLOUD</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap">Having a pentest lab in the cloud has several advantages; it takes up no  space on your machine, the initial investment is small, and it’s easy to  set up and begin using almost immediately. This option is great for  beginners. You need to consider which provider you’re going to go with  and what operating system you can do to your testing on. The cons to  using the cloud are that if you want to use some weirder and more  complex configurations this can be problematic, and you also might be  limited by the cloud company’s terms of service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can use this free site as a start but it is really limited and their Kali Linux OS is really old. Check it out here: <a href="https://linuxzoo.net/"><strong>Linuxzoo.net</strong> </a>. Just register for an account and you can start.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>SOLUTION 2: BEST AND RELATIVELY CHEAP: VIRTUAL MACHINES</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap">If you decide to do it on your own and avoid the cloud, then here’s  what you should look out for. You need a laptop or computer with a  decent amount of memory, think 16GB RAM upwards. This is because if you  are running several VMs they will eat up a lot of memory. It’s also  advisable to have an SSD/HDD of 320GB minimum, but more is definitely  better. This option is cheap if you already have a laptop lying around,  but expensive if you don’t.</p>

<p>Many of you here are new to hacking.  If so, I strongly recommend that each of you set up a "laboratory" to  practice your hacks. Just like any discipline, you need to practice,  practice, and practice some more before you take it out to the real  world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In many disciplines, if you don't practice, you fall victim
 to failure. In our discipline, if you don't practice and fail, you may 
be serving years behind bars. This makes practice and a dedicated 
practice lab an even more compelling argument than with other 
disciplines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of you have been having difficulty setting up  your hacking environment to practice your hacks. In this tutorial, I  will show you the <strong>simplest and fastest</strong> way to set up a lab to practice your hacks before taking them out into the real world where any slip-ups could be devastating!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Download VMware Workstation or Player</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to practice hacking is within a virtual environment. Essentially, you set up a hacking system, such as <strong><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">Kali Linux</a>,</strong> and some victims to exploit. Ideally, you would want multiple operating systems (Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8, as well as a Linux flavor) and applications so that you can try out a variety of hacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Virtual  machines and a virtual network are the best and safest way to set up a  hacking lab. There are several virtualization systems out there,  including <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.citrix.com/" target="_blank">Citrix</a>, Oracle's <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page" target="_blank">KVM</a>, </strong>Microsoft's<strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3702" target="_blank">Virtual PC</a></strong> and <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://microsoft.com/hyper-v" target="_blank">Hyper-V</a>, </strong>and <strong>VMware's <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation" target="_blank">Workstation</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0" target="_blank">VMware Player</a></strong> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx/overview" target="_blank"><strong>ESXi</strong></a>.  For a laboratory environment, I strongly recommend VMware's Workstation  or Player. Workstation is commercial product that costs under $200,  while Player is free. You can also get a free 30-day trial of  Workstation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Player is limited to just playing VMs, while  Workstation can both create and play VMs. Let's download VMware's  Workstation or Player<strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Download Kali VMware Images</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have downloaded and installed your virtualization system, our next step is to download the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/" target="_blank"><strong>VMware images of Kali</strong></a>  provided by Offensive Security. With these images, you won't have to  create the virtual machine, but simply run it from Workstation or  Player—Offensive Security has already created this image for you. This  means that once you have downloaded the VM of Kali, you can then use it  in either Workstation or Player.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/annotation-2019-06-07-121600.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1867" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Unzip Images</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have completed the  download, you will need to unzip the files. There are numerous zip  utilities available for free including <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.winzip.com/mac/en/index.htm" target="_blank">WinZip</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.winarchiver.com/" target="_blank">WinArchiver</a>,</strong>  etc. Download and install one and unzip the files. In the screenshot  below, I have downloaded the free trial of WinZip and have used it to  unzip the Kali files.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Open VMware Image</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once all the files have been  unzipped, our next step is to open this new virtual machine. Make note  of the location where you have unzipped the virtual machine image. Then,  go to either VMware Workstation or Player and go to <em>File -&gt; Open</em> like in the screenshot below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1868} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/annotation-2019-06-07-122034.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1868" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> This will open a window like that in the screenshot below. You can see  that my Kali image was stored under documents, so I browse there and  double-click on the folder. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1869} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/annotation-2019-06-07-122323.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1869" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> When you do so, VMware will start your virtual machine and greet you with a screen like below. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1870} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/annotation-2019-06-07-122552.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1870" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Click on the green button in the upper left below  "Kali-Linux-1.0.9-vm-amd64" that says "Power on this virtual machine."  You should be greeted by the now familiar Kali screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Simply use the user "root" and password "toor" to get started hacking! Happy Hunting!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Download &amp; Install Targets</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the next 
step, you need to download and install a target system. Of course, you 
could use your own host Windows 7 or 8 system, but since this is 
practice, you might want to use an older, easier to hack system. In 
addition, hacking your own system can leave it unstable and damaged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I  recommend installing a Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003, or an older  version of Linux. You can also check above for great resources such as Damn Vulnerable Machines. These systems have many known security flaws that you  can practice on and, then when you become more proficient at hacking,  you can then upgrade to Windows 7 and 8 and newer versions of Linux.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If  you or your friends don't have a copy of these older operating systems,  you can purchase them very inexpensively many places on the Internet. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you can also obtain these  operating systems for free on many of the torrent sites, but BEWARE...  you will likely be downloading more than just the operating systems. VERY often, these free downloads include rootkits that will embed in your system when you open the file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Download Old Applications</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have your 
operating system in place, very often you will need applications to run 
on these older versions of the Windows and Linux operating systems. You 
will likely need a browser, Office, Adobe products, etc. These older 
products have well-known security flaws that you can hone your skills 
on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like the site<strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.oldapps.com/" target="_blank">Old Apps</a></strong>  to download many of these. Of course, once again, you can obtain these  from many of the torrent sites with the same caveat as above of you  might get more than you bargained for.</p>
