<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the most popular digital asset in the market, for the first time in 2019 reached a new high of above ksh.934,500 ($8900) on Sunday before retracting slightly, according to CoinDesk’s price data. The last time Bitcoin peaked that high was in May 2018.</p>

<p>“Goodbye meme triangle, hello $10k+ targets. Some people were  screaming triple top when the more obvious conclusion is retest after  retest of resistance will finally lead to a break to the upside. Bitcoin  could cool off, run sideways but IMO will continue to move up over $10k,” said Crypto trader Josh Rager who is expecting more gains with BTC  pushing past $10k.</p>

<p>If the value of Bitcoin continues to see an upward trend in the coming days, it could very soon breach the ksh. 1,000,000 ($10,000) mark.</p>
