<p class="has-drop-cap">The U.S State Department has already started to put into action last  years proposal of requiring visa applicants to submit their social media  profiles alongside previous email addresses and phone numbers in the  now updated application process under Trump’s administration who had  called for extreme vetting of imigrants during his campaign and now that  he’sin office.</p>

<h3>Nearly All U.S. Visa Applicants Now Required To Submit 5-Year Social Media History</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This new requirement could affect&nbsp;up to 15 million would-be travelers
 to the U.S.&nbsp;“National security is our top priority when adjudicating 
visa applications, and every prospective traveler and immigrant to the 
United States undergoes extensive security screening.&nbsp;We are constantly 
working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes to protect
 U.S. citizens while supporting legitimate travel to the United States,”
 reads the&nbsp;statement from the department to the <a href="https://www.apnews.com/c96a215355b242e58107c2125c18fc4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Associated Press</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This requirement was only reserved to persons of interest for extra 
scrutiny especially if the travelers(65,000 applicants per-year) were 
from countries or regions&nbsp;with a high degree of terrorist activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This new additional vetting is going to affect a lot of people and 
the US&nbsp;State Department had estimated 710,000 immigrant visa 
applications and 14 million non-immigrant visa applicants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new forms require social media usernames, phone numbers, and 
emails the applicant shave used for over the past five years alongside 
their&nbsp;international travel and deportation status. Applicants will also 
be required to state&nbsp;whether any of their family members have been 
involved in terrorist activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those found to lie about their social media use could face serious immigration consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Putting up these new obstacles is going to affect the choices for 
highly-skilled workers who will now have to opt to countries with fewer 
restrictions like neighboring Canda, New Zealand, Norway, Australia, 
Germany, and Switzerland. The U.S is already ranked <a href="http://www.oecd.org/migration/talent-attractiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower</a> in talent attractiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new requirements won’t be applied to certain diplomatic and official visa applicants.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Civil 
rights groups have already joined in condemning this new notice. 
the&nbsp;&nbsp;American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) said that there was no 
evidence that such social media monitoring was effective or fair and 
that it would&nbsp;cause people to self-censor themselves online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ACLU continues arguing that&nbsp;the questions would create “an environment ripe for profiling and discrimination.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my opinion this is a very bad decision. I value my privacy. From Snowden's files, to subpoenaed companies now this?</p>
