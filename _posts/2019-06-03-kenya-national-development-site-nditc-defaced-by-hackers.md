<!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} -->
<p class="has-drop-cap">The National Development Implementation Technical Committee’s (NDITC)  online page has been defaced by the same hacker group (allegedly) that  just <a href="https://ajulusthoughts.wordpress.com/2019/06/03/public-services-portal-ifmis-hacked/">intruded IFMIS website</a>.  This makes it the second government-related website to see attacks from  online criminals who take advantage of security lapses to toy with  sites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the National Development Implementation Technical  Committee was created alongside the National Development Implementation  and Communication Cabinet Committer, 8 Regional Development  Implementation Coordination Committees, as well as 47 County Development  Implementation Coordination Committees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These groups have one primary goal: deliver and oversee the 
implementations of the National Government Development Programmes and 
Projects in Kenya.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike IFMIS website which has seen been relegated to maintenance 
before service restoration, the current culprit is still displaying the 
works of a hacker group calling itself Kurd Electronics Team. This is an
 embarrassing scenario, to say the least, and will land the team behind 
the development of the sites in trouble.</p>

<p>In the  past, and this is entirely theoretical, developers have been known to  deface websites they created to protest late or non-payment. While I do not have the details of this hack, it is apparent there is more to it  besides showcasing the websites’ vulnerabilities.</p>
