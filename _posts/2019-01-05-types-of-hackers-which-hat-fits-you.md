<p>To start is to define a hacker: A hacker is a person with specific skill sets, they use to access computers/laptops/servers/data/information without anyone knowing or gaining authorization/a password.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now there are 2 general types of hackers:- Malevolent Hackers(BAD) and Benevolent Hackers(GOOD). To break this down:-</p>

<h3>White Hat Hackers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Meet  the right guys on the dark web. White hat hackers, also known as  ethical hackers are the cybersecurity experts who help the Govt and  organizations by performing penetration testing and identifying  loopholes in their cybersecurity. They even do other methodologies and  ensure protection from black hat hackers and other malicious cyber  crimes. Simply stated,  these are the right people who are on your side. They will hack into  your system with the good intention of finding vulnerabilities and help  you remove virus and malware from your system.</p>

<h3>Black Hat Hackers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1133,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/baseball-cap-black.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1133" /></figure></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking  credit for the negative persona around "hacking," these guys are your  culprits. A black hat hacker is the type of hacker you should be  worried. Heard a news about a new cybercrime today? One of the black hat  hackers may be behind it. While  their agenda may be monetary most of the time, it's not always just  that. These hackers look for vulnerabilities in individual PCs,  organizations and bank systems. Using any loopholes they may find, they  can hack into your network and get access to your personal, business and  financial information.</p>

<h3>Grey Hat Hackers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1135,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/baseball-cap-grey.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1135" /></figure></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gray  hat hackers fall somewhere in between white hat and black hat hackers.  While they may not use their skills for personal gain, they can,  however, have both good and bad intentions. For instance, a hacker who  hacks into an organization and finds some vulnerability may leak it over  the Internet or inform the organization about it. It all depends upon the hacker. Nevertheless, as soon as hackers use their  hacking skills for personal gain they become black hat hackers. There  is a fine line between these two. So, let me make it simple for you. Because a gray hat hacker doesn't use his skills for personal gain, he  is not a black hat hacker. Also, because he is not legally authorized to  hack the organization's cybersecurity, he can't be considered a white  hat either.</p>

<h3>Script Kiddies<br></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1137,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/script.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1137" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A  derogatory term often used by amateur hackers who don't care much about  the coding skills. These hackers usually download tools or use  available hacking codes written by other developers and hackers. Their  primary purpose is often to impress their friends or gain attention. However,  they don't care about learning. By using off-the-shelf codes and tools,  these hackers may launch some attacks without bothering for the quality  of the attack. Most common cyber attacks by script kiddies might  include DoS and DDoS attacks.</p>

<h3>Green Hat Hackers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1138,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/baseball-cap-green.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1138" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These  hackers are the amateurs in the online world of hacking. Consider them  script kiddies but with a difference. These newbies have a desire to  become full-blown hackers and are very curious to learn. You may find  them engrossed in the hacking communities bombarding their fellow  hackers with questions. You can identify them by their spark to grow and learn more about the hacking trade. Once you answer a single question, the hackers will  listen with undivided attention and ask another question until you  answer all their queries.</p>

<h3>Blue Hat Hackers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1139,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/baseball-cap-blue.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1139" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These  are another form of novice hackers much like script kiddies whose main  agenda is to take revenge on anyone who makes them angry. They have no  desire for learning and may use simple cyber attacks like flooding your  IP with overloaded packets which will result in DoS attacks. A script kiddie with a vengeful agenda can be considered a blue hat hacker.</p>

<h3>Red Hat Hackers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":1140,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/baseball-cap-red.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1140" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Red  Hat Hackers have an agenda similar to white hat hackers which in simple  words is halting the acts of Black hat hackers. However, there is a  major difference in the way they operate. They are ruthless when it  comes to dealing with black hat hackers. Instead  of reporting a malicious attack, they believe in taking down the black  hat hacker completely. Red hat hacker will launch a series of aggressive  cyber attacks and malware on the hacker that the hacker may as well  have to replace the whole system. There are also Red Hats who have no association with hacking, so do note that.</p>

<p>If you've ever come across social activists propagandizing a social,  political or religious agenda, then you might as well meet hacktivist,  the online version of an activist.
