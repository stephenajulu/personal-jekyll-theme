## About

Hey everyone. My name is Stephen Ajulu. I am the founder and lead writer of Ajulu’s Thoughts.
I am also an I.T Pro, Ethical Hacker, Student, Researcher and Entrepreneur. I have founded/co-founded several companies i.e. <a href="https://owlsectechnologies.wordpress.com">OwlSec Technologies</a>, Alusa SS Investment among others.

I’ve created my social media presence because 1) I’ve always had a passion for teaching, 2) bringing awareness and 3) the cybersecurity field is growing in demand faster than it can fill jobs.
My goal is to spread cybersecurity, ethical hacking, privacy and anonymity awareness and help grow our community in the process.

I enjoy playing video games, practicing/fine tuning my hacking skills, creating things(websites, logos, articles, videos), watching Science Fiction(Sci-Fi), Tortured Genius, Horror, Cyberpunk/Hacking Movies(e.g. Mr. Robot) and the occasional action/spy movies.
